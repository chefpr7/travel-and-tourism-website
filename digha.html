		<h2 style="color:#994d00;">How To Reach</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">By Bus, road or train:</p>
<h3>By taxi/shared jeep</h3>
<p>Digha is a 4-5 hr journey by bus from Kolkata.

There are regular and frequent services to Digha from the Bus Terminus (Route 6) in the Garia suburb of Kolkata. Buses run 04:00-08:30 and there is also an afternoon bus service from the same state transport depot. Service is regular and residents from Jadavpur, Tollygunj, Rajpur, Sonarpur can easily use the good service.

There are also frequent bus services to Digha from the Dharamtala bus stand of Kolkata and many other parts of West Bengal.</p>
<p>It is advisable to make reservations in advance for weekends and national holidays.

Three trains run daily from Howrah Railway Station at 06.40 (Tamralipta Express), 11.15 (Duranto Express) and 14.40 (Kandari Express) daily. Sometimes special trains are announced on special occasions and holidays. Notices for such trains are to be found on widely circulated newspapers. A journey by Duront Express (12847) leaving Howrah at 11.15 can be a great experience. The return times are 10.25, 13.35 and 18.20 respectively.
On Saturdays, The Paharia Express comes from new Jalpaiguri and halts at Howrah. This train is often quite empty and very comfortable to travel on.
There is a local train from Shalimar (Near Howrah) to Digha though the timing is not good. Also there may be some special trains.
From 1 July 2011, Indian Railways launched 4 special trains from Puri (W 23:35 & Sa 23:35), Malda Town (Sa 08:10), Vishakapatnam (Th 17:50). .
Now due to work on the 2nd rail line work in the route howrah to digha all the trains getting late upto 4 to 5 hours. so always take your time. and choose ur path of tour.</p>
<p>If you have arrived by train at NJP, you can take a taxi or shared jeep to reach Darjeeling from the booking counter at the taxi stand in front of the railway station. There is also a prepaid taxi stand in front of the train station. Note that if you arrive too late for the jeep to make a return journey from Darjeeling, you may end up paying more</p>

<h2 style="color:#994d00;">Eat</h2>
<p>There are many cheap "rice hotels" all over Digha, serving cheap, but good quality Bengali dishes. There are some more expensive restaurants where continental food is available. In an average restaurant, a vegetarian meal is available for ₹70-90, Bengali fish curry-rice is available for ₹70-150. A meal with egg curry-rice is available around ₹75.

Another great idea would be to just buy the staple vegetarian fare at the hotel you are staying and have it delivered to your room. You can buy fresh fishes like ilish, pomfret, parshe and prawns from Mohona, Digha fish market in the morning and have it cooked at the numerous "Dada-Boudi'r" joints around Sea Hawk. Have this fish with your standard vegetarian lunch or dinner.

In the evening look for fried fish on the sea front in Digha.

Those who are fussy about the quality of cooking, have transport at their command and are looking for tasty fish preparations should go and have lunch at Shankarpur, some 14 km away - they prepare the fish much better than at Digha. The quality at Shankarpur is comparable to the Kolkata 5 star but is comparatively cheaper and the fish as fresh as you can demand. The trouble of travelling would be well compensated.</p>
