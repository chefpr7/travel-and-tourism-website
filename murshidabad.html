		<h2 style="color:#ffff66;">How To Reach</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">By Bus, road or train:</p>
<h3>By taxi/shared jeep</h3>
<p>LSafaris are available from Dhaka,Khulna . Ranging from an overnight trip to a week, and are probably the best way to experience the Sundarbans.

Organizing your own trip from Munsiganj-Satkhira,Mongla or Khulna is possible (and cheaper, if you're a shrewd negotiator), but questionably worth the hassle. You need a permit from the Divisional Forest Office in Khulna. With permit in hand, it's possible to hire a boat from Mongla or Dhangmari to get you to Hiron Point. From Hiron Point you will have to hire a guide to take you into the park.

Day trips from Mongla are not very interesting, and probably better avoided. After negotiating the price of a boat down to something only slightly less rediculous you'll most likely be taken to Karamjal Wildlife Center, where there are some tame deer to feed and some monkeys, crocs and snakes in cages. But surely you didn't come all this way to see a rundown zoo filled with depressed animals and raucous Bangladeshis. Boatmen seem to want no less than Tk 200 for the trip (locals pay Tk 50/day), and the center charges a very steep Tk 750/day entry fee for foreigners.

From Kolkata (India), suburban trains can take you to Canning (64 km) from where launch services are available for Sundarban. Otherwise, you can avail of buses to reach Raidighi (76 km), Najat (92 km), Sonakhali (100 km) and Namkhana (105 km) from where motorboats will take you to Sundarban.</p>
<p>It is advisable to make reservations in advance for weekends and national holidays.

Three trains run daily from Howrah Railway Station at 06.40 (Tamralipta Express), 11.15 (Duranto Express) and 14.40 (Kandari Express) daily. Sometimes special trains are announced on special occasions and holidays. Notices for such trains are to be found on widely circulated newspapers. A journey by Duront Express (12847) leaving Howrah at 11.15 can be a great experience. The return times are 10.25, 13.35 and 18.20 respectively.
On Saturdays, The Paharia Express comes from new Jalpaiguri and halts at Howrah. This train is often quite empty and very comfortable to travel on.
There is a local train from Shalimar (Near Howrah) to Digha though the timing is not good. Also there may be some special trains.
From 1 July 2011, Indian Railways launched 4 special trains from Puri (W 23:35 & Sa 23:35), Malda Town (Sa 08:10), Vishakapatnam (Th 17:50). .
Now due to work on the 2nd rail line work in the route howrah to digha all the trains getting late upto 4 to 5 hours. so always take your time. and choose ur path of tour.</p>

<h2 style="color:#ffff66;">What to Buy</h2>
<p>Baluchari Sarees - They are figured silk saree produced in the town of Baluchar in Murshidabad district. Baluchar sarees essentially have a silk base with silk brocaded designs with respect to their colours, where inspite of a rich composition, the Baluchar bootidars almost avoid strong contrasts. Each pattern is treated in a colour which harmonises with the ground on which it is laid. The most popular colours used are red, blue, yellow, green and scarlet. The Baluchari sarees have large floral motifs interspersed with flowering shrubs. Traditionally the Muslim community was also known to produce these Baluchars with figured patterns depicting court scenes, horse with a rider, women smoking hookah. The Kalka design or the cone motif is often surrounded with floral borders.

Most Baluchar artisans have long migrated to Bankura. Hence Murshidabad is no more famous for Baluchari Saree. Rather one can purchase Murshidabad Silk Kora Saree than particularly for different types of embroidery works in Kolkata. These thans are available in most Khadi shops in Berhampore and Khagra. But purchase it if they provide a rebate of 20% on its printed price. Most of them give it throughout the year even when Govt subsidy is not available. Other things include Shola art, brass, copper and Kansha items.</p>
<h2 style="color:#ffff66;">Eat</h2>
<p>Nothing special in Murshidabad particularly for Kolkatans. Nawabi Ghee-e bhaja chhanabora has been replaced by Dalda-bhaja one. Still Kolkatans can relish sweets and curd of Murshidabad because those are much cheaper here.

If you sit for lunch in a roadside ordinary hotel near Hazarduary, first ask whether the menu follows meal-system or a-la-carte and the rate. Else you may feel cheated after the lunch is over.

There are many good qualiy resturants in Berhampore since it is the administrative headquarters of Murshidabad district</p>
