		<h1 style="color:#191970;text-align:center;font-size: 70px;">Darjeeling</h1>
		<h2 style="color:#191970;">How To Reach</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">By Bus, road or train or plane:</p>
<h3>By Plane</h3>
<p>The nearest airport is Bagdogra, near Siliguri, 96 km from Darjeeling.
Bagdogra Airport is  2.5 hours by road from Darjeeling and two hours by air from Delhi, and 50 minutes by air from Kolkata.</p>
<h3>By taxi/shared jeep</h3>
<p>Siliguri is the nearest town connected to the mainline rail network. Ample transport is available to Darjeeling from here. The most popular modes of transport are taxi (usually shared by three to four passengers), shared jeep (ten passengers)</p>
<p>Shared jeeps depart regularly, from several locations around town. They are probably cheapest at the main bus stand. They leave when full, and are a cheap and fast (but uncomfortable as roads are poorly maintained) way to get to Darjeeling. An air conditioned prepaid taxi will cost Rs.1800 (as of December 2012).</p>
<p>If you have arrived by train at NJP, you can take a taxi or shared jeep to reach Darjeeling from the booking counter at the taxi stand in front of the railway station. There is also a prepaid taxi stand in front of the train station. Note that if you arrive too late for the jeep to make a return journey from Darjeeling, you may end up paying more</p>
<p>Reserve cars also available from Kings Travels dial-09830428401/093319-39486.
</p><p>Tourists often opt to buy an extra seat or two to have more space for the 3 hour journey up to Darjeeling! Luggage is carried for free on the roof. Jeeps may stop for a snack and toilet break on the way up (normally a few km short of Kurseong).
</p><p>While going to Darjeeling from NJP, try to hire a Taxi/Jeep/Sumo with overhead carrier, which has just arrived from Darjeeling, as this will be much cheaper if you hire a vehicle which is going directly from NJP to Darjeeling.
</p><p>Avoid any tour packages at NJP railway station. They will provide you lowest standard hotel.
</p>
<h3>By bus</h3>
<p>There is a regular bus service from Silguri to Darjeeling. However, they are quite slow due to the steep, twisty climb up to Darjeeling. Shared jeeps are faster, but cost double: 200rs vs. 100rs for the bus (2015).
</p>
<h3>By train</h3>
<p>The nearest railway station to Darjeeling is New Jalpaiguri which connects the city with all the major parts of the country. There are a number of trains from cities like Kolkata, Delhi, Guwahati, Chennai, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Bhubaneshwar and Kochi. 
</p>
<h2 style="color:#191970;">Get around</h2>
<p>Darjeeling is a small town and the salubrious climate means walks around town are an extremely enjoyable means of getting around. For longer trips, taxis are available in stands near the entrance to the Mall.
</p><p>Taxis and travel agents sell various tour packages based on "points" which are simply the number of attractions covered.  A 7-point package includes seven places to visit such as the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute/Zoo, Cable Car, Peace Pagoda, etc and takes about 5 hours to complete with the driver waiting at each attraction.  Price in April 2014 was Rs. 1,200 for a dedicated car.  Numerous taxis also sell "Local Sightseeing" trips on a shared basis with up to 10 travelers, in a Tata Sumo or Mahindra Bolero SUV.  
</p><p>Point-to-point dedicated taxi rides start at Rs. 150 for even short distances.  The most economical way is to flag a shared taxi.  Rides are Rs. 10 for short distances and Rs. 20 for longer distances.  Traffic jams are common especially around the mall and bus station areas.  It may be easier to walk rather than sit in a crowded taxi.
</p><p>A great way to spend a day is to take a shared-jeep to Ghoom (the next town up the ridge), visit some monasteries there and walk back to Darjeeling via some of the villages.

<h2 style="color:#191970;">See</h2>
<p>Because it was a popular hill station during the days of the Raj, a lovely Victorian town was built among the Himalayan foothills, the remnants of which are still visible around the Chowrasta and Darjeeling remains a popular summer and fall resort for the natives of Kolkata today. For foreign tourists, the main attractions are the cultural diversity (many Tibetan refugees moved here after Tibet was annexed by China and they co-exist with the descendants of the many Nepali and Bihari laborers brought to work in the tea plantations), the beautiful views (including the wonderful vista view of Kanchenjunga), a variety of trekking options, and the opportunity to cool down after a stint in the plains. The town is also a jumping off point for travelers heading to Sikkim. [18] 4 Days Queen of Hills Sightseeing in Darjeeling.

<h2 style="color:#191970;">What to Buy</h2>
<ul><li> <b>Darjeeeling Tea</b>- Darjeeling is famous the world over for its teas, which are very aromatic and have a delicate taste. Shops selling teas (usually owned by local tea gardens), dot the area in and around the Mall, and at the Chowrasta. Golden Tips & Nathmulls are especially known for their tea and also ship worldwide, but their prices are 3-4 times more expensive than the shops on the road near Rink Mall. Stop by to smell the numerous varieties they have to offer. 'Darjeeling Tea House' located just diagonal to Nathmulls is also a good place to purchase tea. </li>
